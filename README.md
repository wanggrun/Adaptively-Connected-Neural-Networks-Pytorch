# Adaptively-Connected-Neural-Networks-Pytorch
This is the pytorch implementation of "Adaptively Connected Neural Networks" for the currently popular EfficientNet and the efficient DNA network families.

The tensforflow implementation of ACNet can be seen [here](https://github.com/wanggrun/Adaptively-Connected-Neural-Networks).
